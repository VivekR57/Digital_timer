# ‚è∞ Digital Timer Project

The **Digital Timer** project is a microcontroller-based device providing time, date, and alarm functionality with a user-friendly interface. The system utilizes a **PIC microcontroller** and a **DS1307 RTC** chip to manage a **12/24-hour clock**, date tracking, programmable alarms, and an intuitive **menu-driven interface** with a **16x2 character LCD** for display.

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1. **Initialization Phase:** Configure peripherals (LCD, I2C, RTC, keypad) and set the default state.
2. **Main Operation Loop:** Retrieve current time, handle user input, and manage system states.
3. **State Transitions:** Navigate between operational states based on keypad inputs.
4. **Alarm Management:** Compare current time with stored alarms and activate output on match.
